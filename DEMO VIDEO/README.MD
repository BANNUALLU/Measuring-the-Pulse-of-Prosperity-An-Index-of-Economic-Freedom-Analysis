# Measuring the Pulse of Prosperity: An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every individual to control their own labor and property. This project visualizes the Index of Economic Freedom using interactive dashboards and storyboards built with Tableau to empower policymakers, students, and researchers with insights into global prosperity.

The analysis covers 12 key indicators grouped under 4 pillars:
- **Rule of Law:** Property rights, government integrity, judicial effectiveness  
- **Government Size:** Government spending, tax burden, fiscal health  
- **Regulatory Efficiency:** Business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom  
- **Open Markets:** Trade freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom  

Our visual platform fosters a deeper understanding of these factors and their real-world implications.
